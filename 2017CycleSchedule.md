_Note:_ Ready Week is an non-billable week during which The Ready team focuses on our own operating system, culminating in a two-day offsite experience called Ready Retreat. Members should plan and make time for the Retreat and do their best to participate in the rest of Ready Week. Network Members should aim to attend the Retreat with the remainder of Ready Week remaining optional. Client teams should take time to alert their clients to this "dark week" well in advance, assuring them that it will not impact project outcomes (note: we don't charge clients for these weeks).
