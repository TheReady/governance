Payment Terms in SOWs 

The default payment terms in SOWs is Net 30 (although we are flexible to client requests to extend that if they have committed to 3+ cycles).

All invoice due dates should be aligned with cycle start dates whenever possible (billing for the current cycle should occur on the first date of that cycle.)
