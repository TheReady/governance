#Feedback at The Ready

###Three times a year during Ready Week members take the time to reflect on their own performance, wellbeing, and path and share that transparently with other members.

At the same time, other members will provide feedback rooted in personal experience to each other using a tool that enables this process (e.g. a Google spreadsheet, Typeform, a Slackbot).

This process is managed by the chapter leader for the Advocate role.

Members are also encouraged to constantly dialog and retrospect with each other as a way to improve teaming, relating, and operating on client projects, within circles, and as humans beings.
