#Expensify Policy

All members who have a corporate credit card or intend to be reimbursed for personal expenses must join The Ready's Expensify account and file reports with appropriate tags for expenses (client name, purpose, etc.).

Anything below $75 does not require a receipt on Expensify. Anything above $75 requires a photo of the receipt uploaded to Expensify via the mobile app, or forwarded to receipts@expensify.com from your theready.com email.

All members use The Ready AMEX card for business expenses whenever possible, as opposed to personal funds for business expenses.

If personal reimbursement is required (due to a required cash or personal card expense) members should add a deposit account (via Personal Settings & Reimbursement) to enable that process.

All members should get in touch with finance@theready.com for questions around reimbursement.
